                    A child asked his father, "How were people born?" So his
                    father said, "Adarn and Eve made babies, then their babies
                    became adults and made babies, and so on." The child then
                    went to his mother, asked her the same question and she told
                    him, "We were monkeys then we evolved to become like we are
                    now." The child ran back to his father and said, "You lied
                    to me!" His father replied, "No, your mom was talking about
                    her side of the family."
